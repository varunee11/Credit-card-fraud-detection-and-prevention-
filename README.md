# Credit Card Fraud Detection and Prevention System

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for an AI-powered credit card fraud detection and prevention system. The system is designed to identify suspicious transactions in real-time, prevent fraudulent activities, and minimize false positives. It adapts to evolving threats by leveraging machine learning algorithms, anomaly detection techniques, and real-time data analysis. The primary goals are to reduce credit fraud losses, improve detection accuracy, and enhance customer experience.

## Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to develop an accurate machine learning model capable of detecting and preventing credit card fraud transactions in real-time. Key considerations include minimizing false positives, ensuring model interpretability, and optimizing performance for large transaction volumes.

## Problem Statement

The project addresses the critical issue of credit card fraud by developing an AI-powered system that can monitor transactions in real-time and identify suspicious patterns with high accuracy and minimal false positives. This system utilizes machine learning models and behavioral analytics to detect anomalies and adapt to evolving fraud tactics.
